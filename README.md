# MCP Manual Walker 🚶‍♂️

An MCP server to bridge the information gap between AI agents and PDF manuals.

This server scans a directory for PDF files, extracts their bookmarks, and provides tools for an AI agent to access the content of the manuals in a structured, token-efficient way.

## ✨ About The Project

This project was created to solve a simple problem: AI Agents are great, but they struggle with large, unstructured data like PDF manuals. This server acts as a "librarian" for the AI, organizing the information in the manuals and making it easy for the AI to find what it needs.

The server will:

*   📚 Scan a directory for PDF files.
*   🔖 Extract bookmarks from the PDFs.
*   📝 Convert the bookmarked sections into Markdown.
*   🧠 Provide a set of tools for the AI to use.
*   ⚡ Cache the results for speedy access.

### Built With

*   [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/)
*   [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp)
*   [pypdf](https://pypi.org/project/pypdf/)
*   [markitdown](https://pypi.org/project/markitdown/)
*   [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
*   [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/)
*   [Pydantic-Settings](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/settings/)

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python 3.11+ and `uv` installed.

*   [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
*   `uv`
    ```sh
    pip install uv
    ```

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/junkreef/mcp-manual-walker.git
    ```
2.  Install Python packages using `uv`. This command syncs your environment with the `uv.lock` file.
    ```sh
    uv sync
    ```
3.  Place your PDF manuals in the `data/pdfs` directory.
4.  Run the server
    ```sh
    python src/mcp_manual_walker/main.py
    ```

## 🛠️ Usage

The server provides a set of tools for AI agents. The typical workflow is as follows:

1.  Call `list_manuals()` to get a list of all available manuals and their unique IDs.
2.  Use `get_manual_metadata(manual_id)` to retrieve the hierarchical table of contents (bookmarks) for a specific manual.
3.  Finally, call `get_markdown_content(bookmark_id)` to get the token-efficient Markdown content for the desired section.

This process allows an agent to intelligently navigate large documents and only pull the necessary information into its context.

## 🏗️ Building the Database

Building the searchable database (Docling PDF conversion, chunking, embeddings, and ChromaDB indexing) is a separate step from running the server, and it has its own dependencies. Install them first:

```sh
uv sync --extra builder
```

This pulls in Docling, `sentence-transformers`, and the CUDA build of PyTorch (from the `pytorch` index configured in `pyproject.toml`) so embeddings and Docling's models can run on the GPU.

Then run the builder:

```sh
uv run db_manager build --pdf_dir ./data/pdfs [--reset] [--save-markdown]
```

The build pipeline is designed to keep the GPU busy instead of processing one PDF at a time. The main process scans the PDF directory (largest files first), runs a fast metadata pass (hashing + bookmark extraction), and syncs the results to SQLite. It then submits each new or changed PDF to a pool of Docling worker processes for conversion; as each conversion finishes, the main process chunks the text, computes embeddings on the GPU, and writes the result into ChromaDB, so embedding of one file overlaps with Docling converting the next ones. Files whose SHA256 hash hasn't changed are skipped entirely, and rebuilding a manual first removes its old chunks from ChromaDB before adding the new ones.

The pipeline's concurrency and device placement are tuned through environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `METADATA_WORKERS` | `max(1, cpu_count // 2)` | Processes used for the fast hashing/bookmark pass. 1 or less runs it inline. |
| `DOCLING_WORKERS` | `1` | Number of Docling converter processes, each with its own copy of the models in VRAM. The main knob for GPU utilization. |
| `DOCLING_NUM_THREADS` | CPU count | Total CPU-thread budget for Docling, split evenly across `DOCLING_WORKERS`. |
| `DOCLING_DEVICE` | `auto` | Accelerator for Docling's layout/table/OCR models (`auto`, `cpu`, `cuda`, `cuda:N`, `mps`). |
| `EMBEDDING_DEVICE` | `auto` | Device for the SentenceTransformers embedding model (`auto`, `cpu`, `cuda`, `cuda:N`). |

## 🗺️ Roadmap

*   [ ] Implement a more sophisticated search functionality.
*   [ ] Add a web interface for managing manuals.
